## Modifications on top of the Decentraland's released work

1. Many files dedicated to Decentraland specific logic were removed from the ECS package to make it a generic library.
2. An executable file from [decentraland-rpc](https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-rpc) (decentraland-compiler) was moved to its own package inside this repository (ulla-compiler)
3. Package names were changed to avoid confilcts in package managers
